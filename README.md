pymol_syntax
============

Syntax rules for .pml files in sublime text and other textmate-style text editors. I have only tested in Sublime Text but it should work with any color scheme in any editor that uses .tmlanguage files. 

## Use:
For sublime text 3, copy the `pymol.tmlanguage` file into `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/pymol.tmLanguage`

## Contributing:
I am using [AAAPackageDev](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AAAPackageDev) to convert the YAML file into a plist file which is readable by sublime text. Make your changes in that file, then submit changes as a pull request.

## Citations:
The attached vim file is from [Michal Gajda](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2814) and I left it here because I used it a couple times for guidance and it seemed the best way to make it clear that it was an inspiration. I didn't make it!
