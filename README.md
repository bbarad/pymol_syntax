============

Syntax rules for .pml files in sublime text.  
I am using AAAPackageDev to convert the YAML file into a plist file which is readable by sublime text. Problems remain.

Long term goal is to support both "cmd.command(options)" syntax as well as "command option1, option2" syntax.
Feel free to contribute, this is a project on the side for me.
